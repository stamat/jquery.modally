If there are many different variations of the same functionality, the rule says it's easy to make. And the same goes for jQuery modal plugins - they are super easy to make.

I created this plugin as a repo cause I wrote the same code for every project that required modals, over and over again throughout the years, just because it's trivial and I needed 5 minutes to make it.

But regardless, **life is short - make reusable code!**

P.S. Here is an oxymoron for you: I'm one of these people who if they have the time to make something they don't use other people's code, not to have to spend time extending it if god forbids it happens to be needed. Life's not so short now, huh?
